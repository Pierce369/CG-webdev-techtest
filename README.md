Created by Pierce Baker

## Web Stack Chosen
* Bootstrap
* MySQL
* PHP
* XAMPP
* JQuery

I had originally wanted to try using Laravel/Lumen for this project as I have not had the opurtunity to use them in the past, however I spent a day trying to get them to run on my machine and was having an issue with my wsl that I could not figure out in a timely manner. Therefor I chose to use a stack that I was familier with and knew I would be able to get the job done with. I know bootstrap and mySQL relitevly well, and had used php and XAMPP a couple of times before. Therefor I chose those as the base of my stack and started from there.

## Running
Add git repo to your xampp folder ar C:\xampp\htdocs

Open xampp control panel and click start on the apache module

open http://localhost/CG-webdev-techtest/ in your browswe
